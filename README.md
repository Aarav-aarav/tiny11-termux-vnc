# what it does 
what is does is it starts a VNC server and it boots it from a VHD file that is downloaded throughout the installation process using qemu with the best possible things that I can we can use you can optimise the operating system yourself sorry but it doesn't have a web browser you can install it if you get another operating system like Ubuntu and run it with the hard drive that is getting created and then basically in Ubuntu just download the Google installation exe file and then install it in windows by using the start command
